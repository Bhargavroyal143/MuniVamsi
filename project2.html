         <span id="text1" class="text1"> Project Description</span> <br><p class="p1">My project, a women's safety mobile application, serves as a vital tool in ensuring personal security. It empowers users to trigger an emergency alert via SMS or phone call with a single touch during critical situations. The primary goal is to swiftly transmit the user's precise GPS location to pre-defined contacts, updating it every 300 meters. Key features include Geo Fence for continuous location tracking, 'Shake to alert' for discreet activation, and the use of the power button as a distress signal. This project addresses the urgent need for enhanced safety measures, especially for women, leveraging the ubiquity of smartphones in today's society.</p>
